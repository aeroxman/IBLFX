            <p>
              The website www.iblfx.finance is owned by IBCrazy Furious Ltd., a
              private legal entity, NIF No. 2035263, based in the British Virgin

              DeFi products in one place.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through IBLFX Insights, with a collection of e-books and
              explanatory videos, you dive deep into the world of Crypto Assets,
              Blockchain and Finance, as well as publications that have an
              impact on regulatory and accounting models.
            </p>
            <p>
              This Term regulates the minimum conditions necessary for the
              viability of the operation that the User has to maintain with
              IBLFX through the Platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Before registering and trading with the IBLFX Platform,
              understand what a cryptocurrency is.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before registering on the Platform and operating (buying) with
              cryptocurrency, it is necessary to understand blockchain
              technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Blockchain is a technology based on open source encryption
              protocols, regardless of any central authority. It allows people
              to have autonomy over their finances and carry out transfers
              freely and facilitated. Cryptocurrency transactions allow fast
              payments at a very low cost, without the intervention of central
              authorities, financial institutions and issuers. Thus, those who
              have cryptocurrency can sell it, transfer it to someone else or
              use it for purchases of products or serviços on various websites
              on the Internet (which accesses cryptocurrencies as a form of
              payment, of course). Blockchain technology allows you to transfer
              values in a very easy way, allowing the User to control their
              money and, like any currency, it is the responsibility of the User
              to adopt good practices in order to protect it. It is up to the
              user to consult the Blockchain regularly.
            </p>
            <p>
              The value of cryptocurrencies, as in traditional currencies,
              suffers market/quote fluctuations. The price of a cryptocurrency
              can, unpredictably, increase or decrease for a short period of
              time. You may follow the quotations through the Site itself or by
              other Internet sources.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is reinforced that, if the User has doubts about the
              functionality of blockchain technology, he/she must, before
              registering with Platform and operating, look for other sources of
              information other than those presented in this Term.
            </p>
            <p>4. Service</p>
